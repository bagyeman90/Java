Hello World Java Program
This Java program is a simple yet fundamental exercise for anyone learning the language. It serves as an introduction to the basic structure and syntax of Java, demonstrating the creation of a class, defining a method, and utilizing the System.out.println() statement.

Running the Program

To execute this program, follow these steps:

Save the code as a .java file, for instance, "helloWorld.java".

Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where the .java file is stored.

Compile the code by executing the following command:

javac helloWorld.java
This command generates a .class file, which contains the compiled bytecode of the program.

Execute the compiled program using the following command:
java helloWorld
Understanding the Code

The program consists of a single class named helloWorld and its main method. The main method serves as the starting point of the program's execution.

Java
public class helloWorld{
    public static void main(String args[]){
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}

Within the main method, we utilize the System.out.println() statement to display the message "Hello World" to the console. This statement effectively prints the desired output to the terminal window.
